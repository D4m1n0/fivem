For use with Menyoo PC. (https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/menyoo-pc-sp)

To use:

Move the contents of the Outfit folder to [game directory]/MenyooStuff/Outfit

Once you've started the game, open Menyoo, go to 
Player > Wardrobe > Outfits and select it from the list.
**Choose "Apply Clothing and Attachments"**
(This will apply the outfit without without changing your MP character's face.)

Due to a change in GTA V, applying the outfits will now make you bald. There's
nothing I can do about that at my level, so you will have to select your
outfit first, then hairstyle.

Tip: when selecting a hairstyle, use numbers 37 and up. they're still the exact same
hairstyles as before, they're just programmed to react to newer hats/masks/hoods properly.

If you want to play as your GTA Online character in single player, go into Director
Mode, and select them from the casting menu. You can then save them into Menyoo
to load later if you want.
